## Pitch detector dart library

A dart library for pitch detection. It implements the yin algorithm ported from the tarsosDSP library by Joren Six.

## Getting started

To import the library into your project, go to your project pubspec.yaml and add the dependency: 

```dart
dependencies:
  pitch_detector_dart: ^0.0.4
```

## Usage

```dart
//Create a new pitch detector and set the sample rate and buffer size  
final pitchDetectorDart = PitchDetector(44100, 2000);

//Call the get pitch method passing as a parameter the audio sample (List<double>) to detect a pitch 
final result = await pitchDetectorDart.getPitch(audioSample);
```

See the full example here: https://github.com/techpotatoes/pitchup_flutter_sample

#### The result will contain: 
* pitch: The pitch extracted from the audio sample if existent  
* probability: The probability of the pitch found 
* pitched: A flag to indicated if a pitch was identified or not from the sample given
